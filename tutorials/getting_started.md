There are two main ways to use Gameify: As a library, or using the engine.

If you want to use the engine, read {@tutorial intro_to_engine}. This is the easiest
way to get started, as the engine provides many helpful features.

If you'd rather use Gameify as a library, read {@tutorial start_from_library}.
