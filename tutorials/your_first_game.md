For this project, you'll build a simple exploration game. We'll be starting
with a new gameify project, and the sample assets that come with gameify.

If you click "run game" without changing anything, you'll notice that the new
project contains some basic code already, without you needing to do anything.
You can use the `W A S D` keys on your keyboard to move the player (a green
circle) around the map.

### Making a win condition

Your game is pretty boring if you can only move around, so let's add an enemy for the player to fight.
Start by using the sidebar to create an enemy sprite:
