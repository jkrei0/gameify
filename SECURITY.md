# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The `main` branch contains the latest code.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Find something? Go to [the security tab](https://github.com/jkrei0/gameify/security), and submit a report.

## Testing yourself

Please any testing *on your own servers, with your own database.*
If you set it up properly (see the instructions in [`readme.md`](readme.md) and [`engine/README.md`](engine/README.md)), it should be identical.
You can even use vercel's free plan to run it in the cloud yourself, but you'll need to modify [`vars.mjs`](vars.mjs) to set the domains up properly.
